Plan MyWeek
===========

Part of the MyWeek suite alongside upcoming Track MyWeek and Optimize MyWeek apps.

How to use
----------
1) Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or drag into a tab).
2) Click inside the calendar to add a block at that time (or use “+ Add Block”).
3) Use categories to color-code (Sleep, Work, Children, Commute, Training, etc.).
4) Mark “Core work” vs “Alternative focus” for attention-appropriate work.
5) The left panel shows totals (hours) per category per day and your weekly total.
6) Use the Zoom control to adjust the vertical scale. Set day start/end hours and your weekly work target in Settings.
7) Data is saved locally in your browser (no server). Export/Import JSON to back up.

Notes
-----
- Grid density is adjustable via the Zoom control (minutes per pixel) so you can fit the whole day on screen if desired.
- Times use a 24-hour clock and blocks stay within a single day (00:00–24:00).
- Overlaps are allowed; blocks display stacked in the same column.
- You can click a block to edit or delete.
- This is a client-only app—feel free to host it anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, local).

Enjoy!
