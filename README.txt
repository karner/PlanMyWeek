Weekly Planner — Calendar + Totals
===================================

How to use
----------
1) Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or drag into a tab).
2) Click inside the calendar to add a block at that time (or use “+ Add Block”).
3) Use categories to color-code (Sleep, Work, Children, Commute, Training, etc.).
4) Mark “Core work” vs “Alternative focus” for attention-appropriate work.
5) The left panel shows totals (hours) per category per day and your weekly total.
6) Set day start/end hours and your weekly work target in Settings.
7) Data is saved locally in your browser (no server). Export/Import JSON to back up.

Notes
-----
- Grid density: each hour is 60px tall; each minute equals 1px * 2 (i.e., 2px/min); background lines every 30 minutes.
- Overlaps are allowed; blocks display stacked in the same column.
- You can click a block to edit or delete.
- This is a client-only app—feel free to host it anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, local).

Enjoy!
